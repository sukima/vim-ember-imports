1. Intro                                                   *EmberImportsIntro*

Keep your import statements in sync with your code but appending or updating
statements with Ember keywords.

The intended audience for this are Ember developers who use Vim and want to
automate the look up process when it comes to Ember's large set of import
statements. Since the Great Module Unification the API is no longer stemmed off
a single global but instead imported through module namespaces. This make the
code easier to reason about and makes it easier for tools to parse.
Unfortunately it also means memorizing a lot of extra boilerplate.

With this plugin Vim will update the import list for you. By looking up the
import statement for the keyword under the cursor and either adding it or
updating the current one to have the new keyword.

The list was manually copied from https://emberjs.com/api/ember/3.0.0

==============================================================================
2. :Emimport                                                       *:Emimport*

Import statements can be added/updated via a command. The first argument is the
Ember keyword you wish to add. It has auto completion for all the know Ember
keywords. If you leave the keyword blank it will take the word under the
cursor.

Usage:
    >
    :Emimport [KEYWORD]
<
Examples:
    >
    :Emimport
<
    Will lookup the keyword under the cursor and add/update the import
    statement list at the top of the file.
    >
    :Emimport Component
<
    Will add this if it doesn't already exist:

        import Component from '@ember/component';

3. Mapping                                               *EmberImportsMapping*

For convenience a mapping can be used to grab the keyword under the cursor and
execute the |:Emimport| command for you.

By default this is "<Leader>e". The map can be adjusted or disabled. See
|EmberImportsConfig| for more on this.

==============================================================================
4. Configuration                                          *EmberImportsConfig*

Mapping
    You can set the map that triggers the imports plugin.
    >
    let g:vim_ember_imports_map = '<Leader>e'
<
    To disable set to 0.
    >
    let g:vim_ember_imports_map = 0
<
Disable Semicolons
    You can disable the use of semicolons by setting this to 0. (Default 1)
    >
    let g:vim_ember_imports_use_semicolons = 0
<
Definition Wrapping
    To make code easier to read this plugin will break long a import statement
    across multiple lines. Long lines are defined by how many destructuring
    variables there are and how long the line is.

    For example by default if you have more then 3 variables defined it will
    reformat the line like so:

        import DefaultVar, {
          var1,
          var2,
          var3,
          var4
        } from 'foobar';

    This number can be adjusted (0 to disable):
    >
    let g:vim_ember_imports_multiline_max_vars = 3
<
    Alternatively if the line has less then that number of variables but still
    exceeds a maximum column (default: 80) it can split the line in two.

        import DefaultVar, { var1, var2, var3 }
          from 'foobar';

    This can be adjusted (0 to disable):
    >
    let g:vim_ember_imports_multiline_max_col = 80
<
